/**
 * This whole thing is build just for <a href="https://github.com/EhWhoAmI/Monster-Quest">Monster Quest</a>.
 * This will just support: Orthogonal tiles.
 * The reason why I made this, is because I found out that the original <a href="http://www.mapeditor.org/">Tiled map editor</a> could not load files in certain cirmstances,
 * So, I made my own.
